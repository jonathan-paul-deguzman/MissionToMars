# MissionToMars

## Introduction

Our objective is to send a list of items to Mars; we must first run a simulation against our two types of rockets (U1 and U2) to determine which fleet is the correct one to use. The mission is divided into two phases: phase 1 consists of sending equipment and construction material to help build the colony and phase 2 consists of sending a colony of humans and food resources.
